## Coding Conventions ##
Here are a few coding conventions we will adhere to.
1. Use descriptive variable names
2. Add comments
3. HTML id(s) and class names that are not associated with any third party libraries should prepended with **ace** and delimited by **hyphens**. e.g. `<button id="ace-sign-up">Sign up</button>`
