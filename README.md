## Coding Conventions

Here are a few coding conventions we will be using:

1. Use descriptive variable names.
2. Add comments.
3. HTML id(s) and class names that are not associated with any third party libraries should be prepended with **ace** and delimited by **hyphens**.  
   _Example_: `<button id="ace-sign-up">Sign up</button>`
4. Any new dependencies you install should be included in your pull request.

Thanks for adhering!

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page reloads when you make changes.  
You may also see lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.  
See the [running tests guide](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**  
Use this if you need full control over the configuration.
